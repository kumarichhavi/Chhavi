## Build instructions

To start development open the project in Android Studio.

If you want to create your own signed release builds, copy the `gradle.properties.example` file in the `app` folder
and rename it to `gradle.properties`. This file contains the signing information which is used in the build process.
Make sure to edit the file contents to point to your own keystore files.

## History

* The project was started as ["CampFahrplan"][campfahrplan-github] in 2011 and has been developed
by [Daniel Dorau][tuxmobil-github]. He published the app for Chaos Communication Camp
and Chaos Communication Congress in the following years. The app served as a digital
schedule for thousands of users.
* In 2013, [Tobias Preuss][johnjohndoe-github] started contributing. Soon after he
started to redeploy the app for other events such as FOSSGIS, FrOSCon, MRMCD and
other conferences.
* In August 2017 the project moved to a new location and was renamed to
["EventFahrplan"][eventfahrplan-github] to acknowledge its broader usage.
